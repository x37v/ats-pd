#Analysis, Transformation and Synthesis (ATS)

[ATS](https://dxarts.washington.edu/wiki/analysis-transformation-and-synthesis-ats)

This project is a new approach for using ATS in [Pure Data (aka PD)](https://puredata.info/).

Some years ago I wrote an object for PD called `atsread` that simply read out data from an ATS file.
This project uses PD's `structs` to store data that can be visualized as well as used for synthesis.

It is a work in progress!
